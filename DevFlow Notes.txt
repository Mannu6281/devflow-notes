DevFlow Notes

A hackathon-focused tool that helps hackers plan projects, document decisions, and generate clear explanations using AI.

Theme: Hack for Hackers
Sponsor targets: Gemini API + MongoDB Atlas
Level: Beginner-safe, resume-strong

1️⃣ PROBLEM STATEMENT (what you’ll say everywhere)

Hackers often know what they built, but struggle to clearly explain why they built it, how it works, and what the flow is—especially during demos and judging.
DevFlow Notes solves this by helping hackers document their decisions and automatically generate clear explanations using AI.

This is your north star. Never deviate.

2️⃣ MVP FEATURES (ONLY THESE — no scope creep)
✅ MUST-HAVE (MVP)
1️⃣ Project Management

Create a project

Fields:

Project name

Problem statement

Target users

Tech stack

👉 Stored in MongoDB Atlas

2️⃣ Flow & Decision Notes

For each project:

Add notes like:

“Why I chose React”

“What happens after submit”

“How frontend talks to backend”

These notes are human-written, not AI-generated.

3️⃣ Gemini AI Explanation Generator (MANDATORY)

Input: your notes + project info

Output:

Clear judge-friendly explanation

Structured response (problem → solution → flow)

Gemini does not write code.
It explains your thinking.

4️⃣ View / Copy Explanation

Display generated explanation

One-click copy

Use it for:

Demo

Submission description

Verbal explanation

❌ NOT IN MVP (ignore completely)

Auth

Teams

Sharing

Markdown editors

Real-time collaboration

Fancy UI animations

If it’s not listed above, don’t build it.

3️⃣ COMPLETE USER WORKFLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is what you’ll explain to judges.

User opens DevFlow Notes
→ Creates a new project
→ Writes problem & tech stack
→ Adds flow / decision notes
→ Clicks “Generate Explanation”
→ Gemini API processes notes
→ AI returns structured explanation
→ User copies & uses it


That’s it. Simple. Clear. Powerful.

4️⃣ TECH STACK (LOCKED)
Frontend

React

Tailwind CSS

Axios (API calls)

Backend

Node.js

Express

Database

MongoDB Atlas

AI

Google Gemini API

5️⃣ DATABASE DESIGN (MongoDB Atlas)
Collection: projects
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  problem: String,
  targetUsers: String,
  techStack: String,
  createdAt: Date
}

Collection: notes
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  projectId: ObjectId,
  content: String,
  createdAt: Date
}

Why this schema is GOOD

Simple

Relational via projectId

Easy to explain

Atlas-friendly

You can say:

“Each project has multiple notes linked via projectId.”

That’s enough.

6️⃣ BACKEND API FLOW (NO CODE, JUST LOGIC)
Project APIs

POST /projects → create project

GET /projects → list projects

GET /projects/:id → project details

Notes APIs

POST /notes → add note

GET /notes/:projectId → fetch notes

AI API

POST /generate-explanation

Backend does:

Fetch project

Fetch related notes

Construct prompt

Call Gemini API

Return explanation

7️⃣ GEMINI API — HOW YOU’LL USE IT (EXPLAINABLE)
Prompt structure (IMPORTANT)

You will send Gemini something like:

“You are helping a hackathon participant explain their project to judges.
Here is the project problem, tech stack, and notes.
Generate a clear explanation covering:

Problem

Solution

Application flow”

Why judges will like this

You’re not abusing AI.
You’re using it as:

A communication aid

A clarity tool

That’s ethical and smart.

8️⃣ FRONTEND PAGES (MINIMAL)
Pages you need:

Home / Dashboard

List projects

“Create Project” button

Project Detail Page

Project info

Notes list

Add note input

“Generate Explanation” button

Explanation Modal / Section

Shows AI output

Copy button

That’s all.

9️⃣ BUILD ORDER (CRITICAL — FOLLOW THIS)
Phase 1 (Foundation)

Backend setup

MongoDB Atlas connection

Project CRUD

Phase 2 (Notes)

Notes CRUD

Link notes to project

Phase 3 (Gemini)

Gemini API call

Explanation generation

Phase 4 (Polish)

Basic UI

Demo-ready flow

If time runs out:
➡ Gemini working > UI polish
➡ Explanation > styling

🔟 HOW YOU’LL EXPLAIN THIS TO JUDGES (SCRIPT)

Memorize this structure, not words:

Problem
“Hackers struggle to explain their work clearly.”

Solution
“DevFlow Notes helps hackers document decisions and generate explanations using AI.”

Flow
“User creates project → adds notes → AI summarizes thinking.”

Tech
“React frontend, Express backend, MongoDB Atlas for storage, Gemini API for explanation.”

Learning
“I learned how to design data flow and responsibly integrate AI.”

That’s a winning explanation.

11️⃣ IF PROJECT DOESN’T FULLY FINISH (IMPORTANT)

You’re still safe if:

Gemini explanation works

One project + notes flow works

You can demo end-to-end once

Judges prefer:

One working flow
